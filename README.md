# ServiceFabricWebSample
Sample Service Fabric instance with a Web API interface that communicates to various services.  Currently only communicates via RPC.  TCP is on my todo list.

Run the application and navigate your browser to:
```
http://localhost:8729/api/values/statelessCounter
or
http://localhost:8729/api/values/statefulCounter
```
